# RPG Lock
a simple electronic door lock system. It is capable of accepting a 5 digit hexadecimal code. The system must contain a rotary pulse generator, an 8-bit shift register, a pushbutton, and a 7-segment LED display. The 5 digit hexadecimal code is entered by utilizing the RPG and a pushbutton switch. To select a value for the hexadecimal digit, you can operate the RPG by rotating it clockwise and counterclockwise. To confirm the decimal digit, the user must press the push button for more than 1 second. The bounds of the hexadecimal digit values will fall between 0 and F for CCW and CW rotation. Any rotation outside of this will not change the display. After the last hexadecimal digit is selected and the push button is pressed. The code will be compared to the hardcoded key: 77FBC
